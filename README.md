Under The World Ceiling - Lore Repository
=========================================

# About

This repo contains all the lore and story related to the game "Under the World Ceiling" and all derivative works. This not only lets writers easily add changes and more information, but lets interested parties use Github's issue system to report potential contradictions and problems with the story more efficiently than allowed with a traditional wiki.

# Usage

***I will add a document detailing where resources should be stored soon.***

If people would like to contribute, they can clone the repository and add whatever files they want under the following conditions:

* If you are adding resources, note they will automatically fall under the same license as the rest of the content in this repository. If the resource is used in the final game, you will be accredited (along with all other contributors) in the credits of the game.

* All text must use [Github-flavored markdown](TODO).

* All links to other markdown pages should be placed at the end of the page so that named characters, places and events can be more easily linked to if the file is edited again in the future.

* All content added must be your own intellectual property.
